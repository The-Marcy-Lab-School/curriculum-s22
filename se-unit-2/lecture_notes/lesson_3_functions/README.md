### Warmup 

You and your partner will create 3 loops: 

1. Write a for loop that counts and prints up to 10.
2. Write a for loop that counts and prints up to 20.
3. Write a for loop that counts and prints up to 100.


### Reflection

1. What did you notice about the three different for loops that you created? 
2. How can we make this easier? 


### Functions 

1. Create a function that allows you to have to only create one loop and produce the same results of having 3 loops. 
2. How do functions manage complexity? 



### Function Declaration vs Function Expression

Invoke (pass an argument) the three functions below at the top of your program file. Tell us the results and why? 
```javascript
const triple = function(num){
    return num * 3
}


function double(num){
    return num * 2
}

function negative(x){
    return -x
}

```




* function
* function declaration
* function expression
* function invocation
* function argument
* parameters
* global scope
* local scope
* hoisting
