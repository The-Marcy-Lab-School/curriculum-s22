## Types, Values, and Operators (BOG 10 mins)
Create a problem for another group to solve with the following concepts:

1. A problem with a binary operator
2. A problem with a ternary operator
2. Is an automatic type conversion
3. Short-circuiting using logical operators
4. Gives null as an answer 
5. Gives NaN as an answer
6. Uses strict equality
7. Uses non strict equality

## Practice
1. true + false -> to number
2. 12 / "6"
3. "number" + 15 + 3
4. 15 + 3 + "number"
5. !!"false" == !!"true" 
6. false == 'false' 
7.
