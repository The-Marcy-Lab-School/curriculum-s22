### Review

1. Take 5 mins to create an abstract object, i.e. car, dog, human..., and give that object 3 properties and 1 method. _You can use the example from yesterday but CHALLENGE yourself for at least 1 min to do it without any resources._

2. Once you are done, add two additional properties using dot notation or bracket notation. 


### Add an object to our object 

```javascript
let person = { 
    name: "Ann", 
    job: "Senior Lead", 
    isAwesome: true,
    hobbies: ["dog mom", "code", "relaxing"],
    num: function (num){
        return num * num;
    } 
}

```


### for in loop 

How can we use a for...in loop to count the number of properties with number values in the object below? 
```javascript
const crimeSyndicate = {
  boss: 'Superwoman',
  second_in_command: 'Owlman',
  third_in_command: 'Ultraman',
  sub_boss: 'Power Ring',
  henchman: 'Johnny Quick',
  second_henchman: 'White Martian',
  third_henchman: 'Jessica Cruz', 
  commands: 2,
  bosses: 2,
  henchman: 3
}

```

### Difference between key and index, objects and arrays? 

* html ul/ol?

* Why could not having an ordered list be a problem? 



### Create an object instance
