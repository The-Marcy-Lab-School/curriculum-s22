### Warmup: 

1. Declare 10 fruit variables and assign them a value equivalent to their variable name. Once you've declared and assigned your fruit variables, log the value for each variable to the console. 

2. Quickly look up _data structure_ and be ready to explain your understanding of what it does?


### What did we just do? 

<strong>Question 1:</strong> What part in creating and logging 10 fruits to the console would you deem inefficient? 

<strong>Question 2:</strong> What would be the best way to structure the like data?

### Let's get funky with arrays?

1. Let’s create a function that adds an element to the end of a list, just like the push function.

2. Let’s create a function that removes the last element from an array and return it.
