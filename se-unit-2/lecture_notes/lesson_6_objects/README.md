### Understanding Objects 


_An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called as a property. A property can be a function, an array, an object itself or any primitive data type i.e. integer, string, etc. Functions in object are called as methods._


Using the values below to create an object with this exact information. Do this while thinking about: 

<i>1. What is a key?  2. What is a value?  3. What is a property?  4. What is a method? </i>


```javascript
let personName = "Ann";
let personJob = "Senior Lead";
let personIsCool = true; 
let personHobbies = ["dog mom", "code", "relaxing"];
let personNum = function (num) { return num * num };

```



### Accessing Properties:

```javascript
let person = { 
    name: "Ann", 
    job: "Senior Lead", 
    isAwesome: true,
    hobbies: ["dog mom", "code", "relaxing"],
    num: function (num){
        return num * num;
    } 
}

```


#### What are the two ways we can access properties from an object? 
* Dot Notation 
* Bracket Notation


#### What are the ways that we can iterate over objects?

```javascript
const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const property in object) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);
}

```

#### What if we don't want to iterate over a particular property? 

_An enumerable property in JavaScript means that a property can be viewed as iterable (meaning you can loop through it) using the forâ€¦in loop or Object.keys() method. All the properties which are created by simple assignment or property initializer are enumerable by default._


#### How do we delete a property from an object?

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName:"Doe",
  age:50,
  eyeColor:"blue"
};

delete person.age; // or delete person["age"];

// Before deletion: person.age = 50, after deletion, person.age = undefined

```
