# Phase 2: Guided Research - Advanced Topics

## Purpose
This portion of capstone is our most important yet. Over the next three weeks, you will be learning about advanced topics in scalability and performance. These topics will provide the research fodder that will lead to your final capstone projects. As with everything in capstone thus far, you will _not_ be learning each of these concepts to mastery. You will be focusing on the problem that these tools and strategies were built to solve and you will be experimenting and studying them just enough to be confident in your abilities to leverage the tool sometime in the future. Remember, this is _just-in-case_ learning, not _just-in-time_.

## Process
You will **_learn by writing_** throughout this process. You will be given two to three days to study a small set of topics. It is your job to be able to answer the following, **essential questions**:
  * What problem is this technology or strategy designed to solve?
  * How does it solve this problem? (In other words, what _is_ this technology? How does it work?)
  * What _trade-offs_ does it make? (In other words, no tool is perfect. If it were, it would be universally used. What are the downsides of this technology? What uses cases is it _not_ well suited for?)

In addition to learning about these topics, conceptually, there will be some instances where you will be able to learn by _doing_. Whenever possible, I encourage you to experiment with these technologies by either:
  **a.** Creating a toy project or sandbox for experimentation, or
  **b.** Add this technology into your fork of your demo day project

## Assignments
You will have two-_ish_ days to study a given topic or set of topics. **Twice per week, you will submit a blog post on that topic**. This will be easy because your blog post can/will mainly you answering the essential questions in long form. Upon each submission date, we will have a seminar to discuss each other's finding.
