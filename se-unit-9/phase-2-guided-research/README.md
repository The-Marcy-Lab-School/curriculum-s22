# Phase 2: Guided Research

### Purpose
This phase of your Capstone period is designed to expose you to the advanced concepts in your selected domain (systems design or UX Engineering). If you are studying systems design, you will learn how to take your applications from a single instance that exist only on your machine, to scalable, replicated, redundant instances that can deployed to many different machines in order to handle many hundreds of thousands of requests per second while maintaining a high-uptime. 

UX Engineers will learn how to improve performance and accessibility of your frontends. In addition, you will develop some foundational fluency with some key design concepts, allowing you to have an opinion and hold a conversation with the designers that you may be working alongside of in the future.

#### Note
**Disclaimer:** You will _not_ become an expert in _any_ of the topics that you research during this period. This is by design. The purpose of your research should be to (1) discover common problems that occur in applications at scale and (2) have a high-level familiarity with the common solutions available for such problems. Given your strong grounding in the fundamentals, you can rest assured that you will be able to gain the skills and context neccessary to deploy the solution when the problem arises in the future. This part is just about knowing what solutions are out there.
