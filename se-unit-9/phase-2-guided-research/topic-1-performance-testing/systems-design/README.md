## Questions to Get You Started
> _**Reminder:** These have now changed from "Seminar Questions" to "Questions to Get You Started". I can no longer give you the definiitive guide to the key concepts for these given topics. Consider these as a very important starting point and let your curiosity carry you further. ðŸ™‚_ 
* What are the metrics we could use to measure the performance of our applications?
* What is _load testing_?
* What type of response times would we expect from performant web applications?
* How can we use Locust to stress test our applications? 

## Assignments
### Conduct Stress Tests of Your App
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Task** | Choose one app that you will commit to upgrading and refactoring using the new techniques you learn over the next few weeks. Once you have selected the application, run a thorough stress test of the application, using Locust to test multiple key API endpoints.|
| **Purpose** |  To get an initial guauge of how your application performs under heavy load. |
| **Due Date** | Wednesday, June 24 at 2PM |
| **Submission Guidelines** | N/A |

### Complete Stress Test Reflections
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Task** | Once you have run these tests, do the following:<ol><li>Export your test data as CSV and save it to ensure that you can always go back and view the data in raw form</li><li>**Write a test summary** In a short report (about a page), share your thoughts on the following: <ul><li>Where did your application perform well? (your best performance metrics, API endpoints, etc.)</li><li>Where did you application fail? (i.e. Which endpoints experienced unexpected exceptions and high fail rates?)</li><li>What are areas that you are interested in exploring in order to improve the performance of your app?</li></ul></li></ol> |
| **Purpose** | You will be improving this application over time. We want to have a well-documented starting point to refer back to so that we can see improvements over time (and add them to our resumes ðŸ˜‰)|
| **Due Date** | Thursday, June 25 at 9:00AM |
| **Submission Guidelines** | You can write this up in your format of choice (Google Doc, txt file, Markdown file, etc). Submit on Google Classroom. |
