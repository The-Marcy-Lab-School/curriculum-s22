# Phase 2 - Topic 1: Performance Testing

## Purpose
If you are a frontend engineer, you want to ensure that your UI is fast, accessible, responsive, conforms to best practices, and is SEO optimized. Likewise, as a backend engineer, you want to ensure that your site has fast response times, high "uptime", and low failure rates. Most importantly, as aspiring engineers of scalable software, you want all of this to be true when your application is serving many hundreds of thousands (or millions ðŸ˜³) of requests per seconds.

The purpose of this section is for you to get an understanding of how your application is performing now by leveraging performance testing tools. You will run tests on your application, carefully documenting the testing parameters and the outcomes of the test. Over the next several weeks, you will be exploring tools and strategies that are designed to make your software more _performant_. When appropriate, you will implement these tools into existing applications. Then, you will be able to see how these tools impacted the performance of your application.
