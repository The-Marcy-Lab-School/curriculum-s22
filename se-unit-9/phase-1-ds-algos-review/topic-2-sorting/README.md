## Seminar Questions
* What is sequential search? How does binary search work? What conditions must be true in order for you to be able to use binary search?
* How does hashing impact search?
* What is a hash function?
  
#### For each sorting algorithm, be prepared to discuss...
* Describe the algorithm
  * selection sort
  * bubble sort
  * merge sort
  * quick sort
  * insertion sort
  * shell sort

| **Purpose** | To review common questions and algorithms for this topic's data structures. For first round technical interviews, it will not be uncommon for a company to send you a HackerRank challenge, where you will have to submit solutions in an online IDE. In order to practice for this and for virtual whiteboard interviews, we will gain familiarity with these common patterns now. |
