# Review: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues

## Resources
* **Review**: [Unit X Repo](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/se-unit-x-js)
* **Textbook**: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
* **Tutorials**: [Udemy - Python for Algorithms, Data Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/learn)

## Seminar Questions
#### For every data structure, be prepared to discuss...
* What is the data structures?
* For what type of problems is this data structures an ideal solution?

#### Arrays
* How is array data stored in memory?
* What is a dynamic array?
* For a dynamic array, what is the cost of appending to an overflowing array? How does an amortized analysis consider these costs?

#### Linked Lists
* What are the tradeoffs between linked lists and arrays?
* What are the run times for insertion, deletion, and accessing from linked lists?

#### Stacks and Queues
* How does the ordering of stack differ from the ordering of items in a queue?
* Where do we see stacks and queues in the real world?
* What are common use cases for stacks and queues in computer science?

| **Purpose** | To review common questions and algorithms for this topic's data structures. For first round technical interviews, it will not be uncommon for a company to send you a HackerRank challenge, where you will have to submit solutions in an online IDE. In order to practice for this and for virtual whiteboard interviews, we will gain familiarity with these common patterns now. |
