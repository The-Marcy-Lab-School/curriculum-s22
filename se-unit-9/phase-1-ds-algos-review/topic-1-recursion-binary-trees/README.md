## Seminar Questions
#### For every data structure, be prepared to discuss...
* What is the data structures?
* For what type of problems is this data structures an ideal solution?

#### Trees
* Where have we encountered tree data structures thus far in our study of computer science and software engineering?
* What does it mean for trees to be "recursive" data structues?

#### Recursion
* What is recursion?
* What type of problems are best solved using recursion?
* What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

| **Purpose** | To review common questions and algorithms for this topic's data structures. For first round technical interviews, it will not be uncommon for a company to send you a HackerRank challenge, where you will have to submit solutions in an online IDE. In order to practice for this and for virtual whiteboard interviews, we will gain familiarity with these common patterns now. |
