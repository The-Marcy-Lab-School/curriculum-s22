| **Purpose** | To review common questions and algorithms for this topic's data structures. For first round technical interviews, it will not be uncommon for a company to send you a HackerRank challenge, where you will have to submit solutions in an online IDE. In order to practice for this and for virtual whiteboard interviews, we will gain familiarity with these common patterns now. |
