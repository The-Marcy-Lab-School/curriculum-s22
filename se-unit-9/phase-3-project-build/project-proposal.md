## Research Area(s)
> _What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_
* ...
* ...

## Problem Statement
> _Your problem statement is a concise (100 words or less) explanation of the problem that your project will address and the potential impact that the solution will have. In other words, what's "new" about this thing that you're creating and why should people care. For additional guidance, see [here](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/problem-statement/)._

## Proposed Solution
> _In 100 words or less, describe what you plan on building and how it addresses your selected problem? In what ways is your solution novel?_

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> _What are the key technical challenges that your team will have to solve in order to ship this solution?_
