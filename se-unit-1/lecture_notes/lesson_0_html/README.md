## Breakout Group Work (15 mins)

Our goal is to recreate our Tribute Page together

We will start in breakout groups to create the structure and then come together to fill out the content. 

In groups of 2 - 3: 
1. Create an index.html file 
2. Structure the file using the structure 
provided on the image that has been sent to your slack group feed
3. You will only use html opening and closing tags for right now. 
We will return to the main session and fill the content 



LABS 1:00pm - 3:15pm
