### Warmup (3 mins)

1. Why do you think flexbox was created? 
2. Using flexbox requires defining a container as a flexbox container. What CSS property do you use to achieve this? 
3. What are some properties we can use on a container that we define as a flexbox container? 


### Flex Items (5 mins)
* `order` - specifies the order of the flex items.
* `flex-grow` - specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.
* `flex-shrink` - specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.
* `flex-basis` - specifies the initial length of a flex item.
* `align-self`- specifies the alignment for a flex item (overrides the flex container's align-items property)
