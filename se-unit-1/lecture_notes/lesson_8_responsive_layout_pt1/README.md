### WEBSITE 

What do you notice about this website? 

<a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-non-responsive">A Non-Responsive Site</a>


### <u>_Responsive vs Non-Responsive_</u> 

Non-Responsive
1. Non-responsive CSS dictates the size of the borders, images, text, and other design elements, regardless of the screen size.
2. Rather than automatically adapting at a code-level for different screen sizes, unresponsive sites just get smaller to fit a smaller screen. Unfortunately, this often leads to pinching and zooming to read content or interact with the site.

Responsive
1. Responsive design enhances mobile-friendliness
    - Adapt To Multiple Devices Sizes
2. Responsive design provides better user experiences
    - Readable text without requiring zoom
    - No horizontal scrolling
