### Lab Review 

* <u>Commenting on git commits </u>: 


_The most important part of a commit message is that it should be clear and meaningful. In the long run, writing good commit messages shows how much of a collaborator you are. The benefits of writing good commit messages are not only limited to your team, but indeed expand to yourself and future contributors_

Questions it should address
```
1. Describe why a change is being made.
2. How does it address the issue?
3. Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.
4. Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.
5. Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.
6. The first commit line is the most important.
7. Describe any limitations of the current code.

```

How it should be written moving forward
``` 
feat:     The new feature being added to a particular application
fix:      A bug fix
style:    Feature and updates related to styling
refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
test:     Everything related to testing
docs:     Everything related to documentation
chore:    Regular code maintenance

```

Example: 

<strong>Bad example: </strong> <br>
`git commit -m "Add margin"`

<strong>Good example: </strong> <br>
`git commit -m "style: Add margin to nav items to prevent them from overlapping the logo"`
