# Unit 1 Lesson 5 Lecture: Flexbox
## September 25, 2019

### Vocabulary
* flex container
* flex item
* main axis
* cross axis

## Key Properties
* `display`
* `flex-direction`
* `justify-content`
* `align-content`
* `flex-grow`

## The Why
* Flexbox aims to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.
* The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).
* A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
