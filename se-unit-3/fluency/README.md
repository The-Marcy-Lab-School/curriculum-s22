# More Fluency Practice

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the perfect squares:
```js
findSquares([1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 25]); // [1, 4, 9, 25]
```

2. Write a function that takes a string and returns that string in snake case (all lowercase characteres with underscores between words):
```js
snakeCase("This is a Sentence"); // "this_is_a_sentence"
```

3. Write a function that takes a string and returns that string in title case (first letter of each word is capitalized with spaces removed):
```js
titleCase("This is a Sentence"); // "ThisIsASentence"
```

4. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array of the the absolute values:
```js
absolute([4, -2, 7, 9, -4, -3]); // [4, 2, 7, 9, 4, 3]
```

5. Write a function that sorts an array of people objects by their age with the oldest first and the yougest last:
```js
const people = [{name: "Paul", age: 5}, {name: "Carmen", age: 1}, {name: "Steph", age: 10}, {name: "Anne", age: 3}];
sortOldest(people);
// [{name: "Steph", age: 10}, {name: "Paul", age: 5}, {name: "Anne", age: 3}, {name: "Carmen", age: 1}]
```
