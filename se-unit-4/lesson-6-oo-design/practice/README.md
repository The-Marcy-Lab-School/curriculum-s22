## Design Challenge 

Design an Amazon Store using Object Oriented JavaScript. What classes can you create? and How are they related?

For example, you cound have a `User` class, an `Cart` class, and an `Item` class.

A User has a cart (and only one cart), but a cart can have a list of many items.

There are many possible solutions, and you get to be as creative as you want to be!
