# Code Challenge
## Tuesday, December 2, 2019

Write a function that takes the name of a day (e.g "Monday", "Tuesday") and an integer offset, and returns the name of the day which would be the original + offset.

Extra credit: _Use the JavaScript `Date` object!_

Example:
```javascript
dayOffset("Wednesday", 4); // "Sunday"
```
