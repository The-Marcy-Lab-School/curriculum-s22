Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * The order of indices in your output does not matter.
   * example input: ``[2, 7, 11, 15]``, target = `9` --> `[0, 1]` (or ``[1, 0]``), because `input[0] + input[1] === 9`.
 * `@param { Array } nums` - an array of integers
 * `@param { Number } target` an integer
 * `@return { Array }` the indices of two numbers that add up to the target
