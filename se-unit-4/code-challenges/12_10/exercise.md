## Tuesday, December 10, 2019

Write a function that takes a year as an argument, and returns the number of 'Friday the 13ths' in that year. You may assume that the year is greater than `1752` (when the modern Gregorian Calendar was adopted by the United Kingdom). You may also assume that the same calendar will remain in use for the foreseeable future.

```javascript
fridayThe13ths(1986);      // 1
fridayThe13ths(2015);      // 3
fridayThe13ths(2017);      // 2
```
