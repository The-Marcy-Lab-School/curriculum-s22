3. Switch to f1 branch 
4. Add one feature to README.md 
5. Commit (make sure to leave a comment on what you added) 
6. Repeat step 4 - 5 three more times 

1. Switch to f2 branch 
2. Add one feature to README.md 
3. Commit (make sure to leave a comment on what you added)

13. Push 

1. Merge branch f2

3. Resolve conflict 
4. Push changes 

```

```
Using the following commands below we will add branches to our existing TikTok_repo from the command line

* git checkout -b <branch-name> to create a new branch and switch to it
* git checkout <branch-name> to switch branches
* git branch <branch-name> to create a new branch but doesn't siwtch to it
* git branch to list all branches. A branch doesn't exist until there is at least one commit in it
* git merge <branch-name> means you are merging the commits in branch-name INTO the current branch you are on!
* git branch -d <branch-name> to delete branch. You can't delete branch you are currently on

```
