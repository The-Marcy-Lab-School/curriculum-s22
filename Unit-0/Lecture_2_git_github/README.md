## Group Challenge

In groups of 2 or 3, complete the following:

```
1. Create a directory named "git_practice" on the 
environment level of your directory tree (you will delete this folder later)
2. Navigate to the git_practice using one of the commands learned in class yesterday
3. Once you are in that folder, type git status
4. If you receieved a message stating 
"not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git" 
that's perfect
5. There's a command for initializing a git repo, find it and use it 
6. Once you've initialized it, check the status using git status
7. Add a text file (whatever name you want.txt) to 
the folder(directory) that you are currently in 
8. Once added, check the git status again (make sure to see there are changes)
9. Find the command for adding changes to the git repo and add your changes
10. Commit your changes 
11. Check your git status
12. Repeat steps 7 - 11 two more times 

```
