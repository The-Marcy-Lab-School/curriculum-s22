# Unit X - Lesson 0
## Algorithm Analysis

### Essential Questions
* What is an algorithm?
* How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm?
* Why is it important to assess how an algorithm's runtime grows in relation to the size of its input?
* What are common algorithm runtimes and how do they describe how and which algorithms are associated with them?

### Key Terms
* Big-O Notation
* Runtime complexity
* O(log _n_) - log time
* O(_n_) - linear time
* O(_n_ * log _n_) time
* O(_n_<sup>2</sup>) - quadratic time
* O(_n_!) - factorial time
