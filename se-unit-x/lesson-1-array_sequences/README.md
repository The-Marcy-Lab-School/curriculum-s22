# Unit 11 - Lesson 1
## Array Sequences

### Essential Questions
* How is array data stored in memory?
* What does it mean for an array to be _referential_?
* What happens to referenced objects when an array is sliced or copied?
* What is a dynamic array?
* For a dynamic array, what is the _cost_ of appending to an overflowing array? How does an _amortized analysis_ consider these costs?

### Key Terms
* referential array
* dynamic array
* amortized analysis
