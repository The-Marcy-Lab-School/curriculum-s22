# Unit 6 Lesson 2: Making "Fetch" Happen

## Key Terms:
- Promises
- Fetch
- Query strings
- Request/Response Headers
- Metadata

## Essential Questions:
- How can higher order functions be utilized to more DRY (don't repeat yourself) AJAX requests?
- How do metadata and query strings impact AJAX requests?
- How can code be written for the edge cases when APIs don't return the expected data?
