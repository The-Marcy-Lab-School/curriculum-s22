 *
 * 		Mx. Promise: Sure thing!
 *
 * 		Raul: While you are doing that, I will prepare itemB.
 * 		But make sure you let me know whether you could find itemA.
 *
 *		Mx. Promise: What if you are not at home when I am back?
 *
 *		Raul: In that case, send me a text message saying you are

 * 		If you donâ€™t find it, call me back immediately.
 *

const potentialSolution1 = `
	 Potential response:
	 A Promise is Javascirpt object representing the eventual completion
	 or eventual failure of an asynchronous operation. Essentially, a promise
	 is a returned object to which developers attach callbacks,
	 instead of passing callbacks into a function as with prior handling
	 of making requests. In this analogy above:

	 Raul makes something similar to an AJAX Request. While that request
	 is running, there is another asynchronous operation (preparing itemB)
	 that takes place. The return value will either be the data fetched
	 by the AJAX request or some other callback will be invoked to deal with
	 the lack of the appropriate data being sent.
