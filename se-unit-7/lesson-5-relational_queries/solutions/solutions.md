# Unit 7, Lesson 5

## Relational Queries

### Solutions

**Exercise 0:**
Any time information is one-to-one _(ie. one user typically has one username matched with one password)_, then it's probably better to have it one table, since **single tables can reduce the number of joins the database will need to do in order to retrieve results**. If the data is one-to-many _(ie. many article stories can have many different tags)_, then it should be split into separate tables because **joins can reduce duplicate data, which can waste storage space, cache space, and makes the database harder to maintain.**
