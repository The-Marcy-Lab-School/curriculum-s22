# Lesson 1 Practice Exercises

1. Describe the purpose of HTTP Status Codes. Why are these important?

**Suggested Answer** HTTP Status codes provide a uniform way to describe the outcome of a web request. This means that clients can easily determine what happened when the request was made. For example, if the server encountered an error, the client may want to respond differently.

2. What is the difference between a URL and a URI?

**Suggested Answer**

A "URI" is a Uniform Resource Identifier, and refers to any means of identification for a resource. For example, a bar-code for a product in a grocery store could be considered a URI.

A "URL" is a Uniform Resource Locater, which refers to how you might find the resource as well as identify it.  In the web development world, this generally refers to something containing the protocol (i.e. `http://`), and the location (i.e. `google.com`)

3. What is the purpose of query params? How do we use them in our applications? Try to use a real-world example if you can!

**Suggested Answer**

Sometimes, we may want to collect additional, optional information from the user. For example, visiting https://twitter.com/search displays a search bar, as well as some default tweets. However, visiting https://twitter.com/search?q=dogs displays all results related to the search for "dogs".

4. What is the client and what is the server in this exercise?

**Suggested Answer**

In this example, the client is the web browser. The server is hosted on my machine/computer. I can view the status of my server within the terminal.
