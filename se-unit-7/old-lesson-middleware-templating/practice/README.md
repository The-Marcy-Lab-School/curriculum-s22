## Lesson 3 - Practice

0. In your own words, what is the purpose of middleware in web applications? Why is it useful?

1. Write a custom middleware function for an express application that tracks how many times a page has been viewed and logs that count to the console. You should account for the app being able to display multiple, different pages. 

2. How do templates fit into web applications? Why are they useful?

3. Choose your favorite dynamic web app (i.e. Facebook, Youtube, Soundcloud) and visit your home page. What do you think the template might look like that renders that view? What pieces of data are stored that relate to your profile?  

4. Write a route that renders the current time dynamically using an EJS template. Your solution should include both the template file and the route/action.
