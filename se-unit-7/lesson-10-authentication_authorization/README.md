# Authorization and Authentication

## Key Terms:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- OAuth
- Tokens
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Sessions
- Cookies

## Essential Questions:
1. What is the difference between _authorization_ and _authentication_.
2. What is the difference between a _session token_ and a JWT, or a _JSON Web Token_?
3. How can engineering teams defend against security risks?
4. What are cookies and how do they facilitate a _stateful_ web experience?

## Practice
### Tools
This tutorial will introduce you to the tools that we will use to authenticate users in our own applications (`bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken`).

### Theory
These practice exercises will push your understanding of full stack web development. The goal is to help you understand some of the most common security risks and how to defend applications against those risks as an engineer.
