# Pokemon Application

In this application, you'll build an app to display a list of Pokemon. Use the `fetchPokemon` function to interact with the Pokemon API.

Install the packages using `npm install` or `yarn`, and run the test suite using `npm test` or `yarn test`. Build in order to get the tests passing. 

The test uses a mocked version of the `fetchPokemon` function - basically, instead of actually calling the API, we fake an API call so we don't have to actually interact with that service. We'll learn more about mocking in a future lesson.
